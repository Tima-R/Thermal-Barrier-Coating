# Thermal Barrier Coating
Comparative Analysis of Alumina and Mullite as Thermal Barrier Coatings for Turbine Blades

# Overview
The project investigates and compares Alumina (Al2O3) and Mullite (3Al2O3·2SiO2) as thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) on turbine blade alloys. The focus is on their manufacturing costs and surface hardness when applied using different deposition methods.

# Key Features or Functionalities
Material Comparison: Evaluation of Alumina and Mullite in terms of cost and hardness.
Deposition Methods: Assessment of different coating techniques on the performance of the materials.
Recommendation: Providing an optimal choice of material and method for turbine blade applications.

# Results
Material Performance: Alumina (Al2O3) proved to be more cost-effective and demonstrated superior surface hardness compared to Mullite (3Al2O3·2SiO2), making it the preferred material for applications that prioritize wear resistance.
Coating Techniques: Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) emerged as the most effective coating method for both materials, leading to the highest surface hardness compared to EBPVD and CVD.
Cost-Effectiveness: Alumina's intrinsic hardness and the availability of abundant raw material make it the more economical choice. Its simpler processing techniques further contribute to its cost-effectiveness.
Material Recommendations: Alumina, applied via PVD, is recommended for its optimal combination of cost-efficiency and enhanced surface hardness, making it particularly suitable for turbine blade applications.
